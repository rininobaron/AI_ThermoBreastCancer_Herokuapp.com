In This repository you can found files necesary for deployign a this prototype written in python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Linux Shell Scripting Language to deploy a Web App.

This prototype hopes you send any .npy file because is not performanced to specific raw thermocam file.

I will share more images in npy format and documentation about prototype and IBM Watson ML Deploy models ASAP but, meanwhile you can try with your own Thermal Images and Machine Learning models.

This web app was deployed in Heroku using a free cloud services and has limited resources. Hence, I recommend you run it on your local server or any Cloud Computing Service like IBM Cloud, Azure, AWS or GCP if you want a better performance.

Lastly but not least this Web App only support 6 queries per month because IBM Watson policies machine larning models.
